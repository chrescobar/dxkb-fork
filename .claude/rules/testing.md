# Testing Rules

## Node Version

Tests require **Node.js >= 22** (vitest 4.x / rolldown needs `node:util#styleText`). The project targets **Node v24**. Use `nvm use 24` (or the `.nvmrc` if present) before running any commands.

## Test Runner

The project uses **Vitest 4** with jsdom environment. Config lives in `vitest.config.mts`, setup in `vitest.setup.ts`.

```bash
pnpm test             # Run all tests once (vitest run)
pnpm test:watch       # Watch mode
pnpm test:coverage    # Run with V8 coverage
```

## Coverage

V8 coverage with floor thresholds enforced by `pnpm test:coverage`. **`vitest.config.mts`'s `thresholds` block is the authority** — if these numbers ever disagree with it, the config is right and this table is stale. At the time of writing it enforces:

| Metric     | Floor |
| ---------- | ----- |
| lines      | 87    |
| statements | 86    |
| functions  | 90    |
| branches   | 77    |

- Floors sit 1–2 points below the measured baseline so unrelated PRs don't trip on rounding drift. Bump them upward when new tests raise the measured numbers; **never lower them** — and never lower the config to match a stale figure here.
- Scope: `src/lib/**`, `src/hooks/**`, `src/contexts/**`, `src/app/api/**`, `src/app/services/page.tsx`. Excludes `src/components/ui/**`, `*.d.ts`, `types.ts` / `types/**`, `src/**/__tests__/fixtures/**`, and `src/lib/e2e-fixtures/**` (fixture data, not product code — its near-total coverage inflated every metric).
- These percentages describe **only** the server/library subset `include` names above. All of `src/components/**` except the `ui/**` exclusion is outside the measurement, so a high number here says nothing about the UI layer. Widening `include` to add the component layer is a separate, separately baselined coverage-policy change — do not widen it and reuse these floors.
- Reporters: `text`, `html`, `json-summary`, `json` (HTML report at `coverage/index.html`).

## CI / GitHub Actions

These workflows run automatically on every PR targeting `main`, `test`, `dev`, or a `DXKBCORE-*` stack branch:

| Workflow  | File                                   | Command          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Lint      | `.github/workflows/pnpm-lint.yml`      | `pnpm lint`      |
| Typecheck | `.github/workflows/pnpm-typecheck.yml` | `pnpm typecheck` |
| Build     | `.github/workflows/pnpm-build.yml`     | `pnpm build`     |
| Test      | `.github/workflows/pnpm-test.yml`      | `pnpm test`      |
| E2E       | `.github/workflows/pnpm-e2e.yml`       | `pnpm e2e`       |
| A11y      | `.github/workflows/pnpm-a11y.yml`      | `pnpm a11y:meta`, `pnpm a11y:routes`, `pnpm a11y:deep`, `pnpm a11y:keyboard`, `pnpm a11y:tripwire`, `pnpm a11y:primitives` |

(Also present: `e2e-har-refresh.yml` and `sync-linux-snapshots.yml` for maintenance, not per-PR gates.)

The core four (Lint, Typecheck, Build, Test) must pass before merging. `pnpm typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit` and catches TS errors in test files that `pnpm build` skips. Run all four locally before committing (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Test Conventions

- Test files live in `__tests__/` directories next to the source they cover (e.g. `src/lib/__tests__/utils.test.ts`).
- Use `vi.mock()` for module mocks. Do not reference variables declared with `const`/`let` inside a `vi.mock` factory — vitest hoists the factory above all imports, so the variable will not be initialized yet. Instead, import the mocked module inside the test and access its mock there.
- Prefer `expect.objectContaining()` over non-null assertions (`!`) to satisfy the `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` rule.
- Globals (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`) are available without importing (configured via `globals: true`).

## Shared Test Helpers

`src/test-helpers/` contains the building blocks shared across the unit suite — prefer these over hand-rolling per-test:

- `msw-server.ts` — Shared MSW server (see "Mocking HTTP Requests with MSW" below).
- `api-route-helpers.ts`:
  - `mockNextRequest({ method, url, body, headers, searchParams })` — Build a `NextRequest` for route handler tests. Use this instead of `new Request(...)` or hand-rolling Next internals.
  - `makeRouteContext(id)` — Build the `{ params: Promise<…> }` second argument for App Router route handlers.
  - `json(res)` — Tiny `res.json()` shorthand.
- `react.ts`:
  - `createQueryClientWrapper()` — `QueryClientProvider` wrapper (with `retry: false`) for `renderHook` and React tests that touch TanStack Query.
- `history-navigation.ts` — `historyNavigationMock({ pathname })`, a `next/navigation` mock for components whose URL state is written with `window.history.pushState`/`replaceState` (the `ResourceChildCollection` tests use it). The usual per-file `next/navigation` mocks return a fixed `useSearchParams`, which, unlike Next's, does not change when the History API writes; this one re-renders its subscribers on every write, which a test that pages or sorts a real child table needs. Build it inside the `vi.mock` factory and reset the address with `history.replaceState` in `beforeEach`.

See `src/app/api/auth/profile/__tests__/route.test.ts` for a representative usage.

## Mocking HTTP Requests with MSW

Use [MSW (Mock Service Worker)](https://mswjs.io/docs/) to intercept HTTP requests in tests — do **not** use `vi.mock()` to mock functions like `fetch` or `serverAuthenticatedFetch`. MSW intercepts at the network level, which exercises the real request code paths (headers, serialization, error handling).

- A shared MSW server is configured in `src/test-helpers/msw-server.ts` with lifecycle hooks in `vitest.setup.ts` (strict mode — unhandled requests error).
- Use `server.use()` inside individual tests to add request handlers. Handlers are automatically reset after each test via `afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())`.
- For server-side code that depends on `next/headers` cookies (for example `readSession`, `getCurrentUser`, or `withAuth`), use `setTestSession({ token, userId, realm })` from `api-route-helpers.ts`, which configures the global test cookie store installed by `vitest.setup.ts`; let the real auth functions run so outbound calls hit MSW.
- Mock `next/headers` directly only in tests that intentionally replace the shared cookie-store behavior itself.

- Set env vars (e.g. `process.env.USER_URL`) in `beforeEach` / `afterEach` instead of mocking `getRequiredEnv`.
- See `src/lib/auth/server/__tests__/session.test.ts`, `server/__tests__/actions.test.ts`, and protected route tests using `setTestSession` for reference examples.

## Linting Rules

- All variables and constants use `camelCase` — including module-level `const` exports. Do not use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (that is a C/Java convention, not TypeScript/JavaScript).
- The only exceptions are environment variable names (OS convention) and zod schema objects which conventionally use camelCase anyway.
- Do not use `//eslint-disable` comments, fix the code instead. If you absolutely must use them, add a comment explaining why.

## Playwright (E2E) Rules

### Scope

- E2E specs live under `/e2e/tests/**`. One spec file per route family; visual-regression specs under `/e2e/tests/visual/`.
- Do **not** add Playwright tests that duplicate Vitest coverage (auth route handlers, hooks, contexts, units). Reserve Playwright for: multi-page browser journeys, cross-browser parity, and jsdom-impossible interactions (file upload, drag/drop, 3D viewer).
- Accessibility has its own suite under `e2e/tests/a11y/` (routes-sweep, keyboard, deep-tier, reduced-motion, coverage.meta) with a dedicated config (`playwright.a11y.config.ts`, plus `playwright.a11y.meta.config.ts` for the browser-free `coverage.meta` checks) and scripts (`pnpm a11y`, `pnpm a11y:routes`, `pnpm a11y:keyboard`, `pnpm a11y:deep`, `pnpm a11y:motion`, `pnpm a11y:meta`, `pnpm a11y:tripwire`, `pnpm a11y:mobile`, `pnpm a11y:primitives`). Add new routes to `routes-sweep.spec.ts` rather than spreading axe checks across journey specs. Primitive-level a11y unit tests run under `vitest.a11y.config.mts`. See `docs/a11y-manual-checklist.md` for the manual checklist.
- Before committing: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm e2e --project=chromium` for a fast local check (full three-browser matrix runs in CI).

### Page Objects

Specs interact with the app through page objects in `e2e/pages/` (e.g. `SignInPage`, `WorkspacePage`, `ServiceFormPage`, `JobsListPage`). New specs should add or extend a page object rather than embedding raw selectors. Each page object is a thin wrapper exposing `goto()`, semantic actions (`signIn()`, `uploadFile()`, etc.), and assertions — keep it focused on the page's surface, not test logic.

### Setup Projects + Storage State

`playwright.config.ts` defines two setup projects that run before browser projects:

- `setup-signed-in` (`e2e/auth/signed-in.setup.ts`) — Seeds production-named HttpOnly session cookies and writes `e2e/.auth/e2e-signed-in.json`. The `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit` projects depend on it and load that storage state by default. Auth lifecycle specs use empty state and exercise real local sign-in/sign-out separately.
- `setup-public` (`e2e/auth/public.setup.ts`) — Empty storage state for unauthenticated specs (`e2e/.auth/e2e-public.json`).

`playwright.a11y.config.ts` reuses the same two setup specs under its own project names (`a11y-setup-signed-in` / `a11y-setup-public`) and its own destination files (`e2e/.auth/a11y-*.json`). The destinations come from `e2e/auth/storage-state.ts`, keyed by project name — the two configs deliberately do not share one file, so a `pnpm e2e` and a `pnpm a11y` cannot race on the storage state. Other single-file artifacts are still shared between concurrent runs of the *same* config and would overwrite each other: `a11y-summary.json`, and the JSON reporter's `results.json` (which only exists under `CI=true`). That overwriting is **not** why the heavy suites are run sequentially — that rule is about resource contention on the dev machine, as `e2e/auth/storage-state.ts` and `e2e/a11y/README.md` both state; CI runs one sweep per job. Point any new project at an exported constant from that module rather than a path literal.

Specs that must run logged-out should override with `test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } })` (or the public storage path) at the top of the spec.

### Backend Mocking

Two layers, both required for full isolation:

1. **Browser-side** — `applyBackendMocks(page, { overrides })` from `e2e/mocks/backends.ts` intercepts requests made from the page via `page.route()`.
2. **Server-side (loopback)** — Server Components and route handlers fetch through env vars (e.g. `APP_SERVICE_URL` and `USER_URL`) that `.env.e2e.test` rewrites to `http://127.0.0.1:${E2E_PORT}/api/e2e-mock/<service>`. The loopback handler returns endpoint-correct identity responses and deterministic service fixtures. Its dispatch is fail-closed: an unregistered path or JSON-RPC method gets a diagnostic `400` naming what is missing (grep the webServer log for `[api/e2e-mock] e2e-mock: `), never an empty success, so a new server-side backend call needs a fixture registered in `route.ts` as well as an env var in `.env.e2e.test`. Playwright's `page.route()` cannot see server-side fetches, so this layer is mandatory — and a green browser-side run is not evidence that the loopback is complete.

Because of the env-loading dance, the Playwright `webServer` runs `node e2e/scripts/start-webserver.mjs ${port}` instead of `next start` directly. Run `pnpm build` before `pnpm e2e` (the wrapper does not rebuild).

### HAR Replay Modes

- **Strict HAR canary replay** — Add endpoint-specific setup overrides followed by `...harOverridesFor("journey.har")` inside `applyBackendMocks(page, { overrides: [...] })`. Do not layer `journeyOverrides`, `emptyBackendFallbackOverrides`, or another broad aggregate over replay; unrecorded traffic must fail loudly. See `e2e/README.md` and the HAR blocks in `workspace-browse.spec.ts` and `genome-assembly.spec.ts`.
- **Body-aware journey replay** — `harOverridesFor("journey.har")` groups recorded entries by path, HTTP method, and JSON-RPC method. Repeated calls replay in HAR order through the generated override's body function; callers do not pass a second argument.
- HAR files live in `e2e/fixtures/hars/` (committed). Record with `pnpm e2e:record <journey>` against a real backend (local only — never in CI).
- Hand-written overrides live in `e2e/fixtures/overrides/` and run before HAR replay.

### Snapshots

- Chromium: strict (zero-pixel diff). Firefox / WebKit: `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.05`.
- PNGs are platform-specific (`-darwin` / `-linux`); `pnpm e2e:update-snapshots` only writes the host OS set. Refresh `-darwin` locally on a Mac; refresh `-linux` from a failing CI run (do NOT use QEMU docker on Apple Silicon — busts chromium tolerance). Full runbook: `e2e/README.md` → "Visual regression".
