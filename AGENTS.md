# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start dev server with Turbopack on port 3019
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm test         # Vitest (run once)
pnpm test:watch   # Vitest (watch mode)
pnpm test:coverage # Vitest with V8 coverage
pnpm e2e          # Playwright e2e suite (all browsers)
pnpm e2e:ui       # Playwright UI runner
pnpm e2e:record <journey>  # Record a HAR against live backend (local only)
```

Requires **Node v24** (`nvm use 24`). Vitest 4 / rolldown needs Node >= 22.

## Architecture Overview

**DXKB V2** is a Next.js 16 app (App Router) serving as a Disease X Knowledge Base — a bioinformatics platform for genomics, metagenomics, and viral research.

### Key architectural layers

**App Router structure (`src/app/`)**

- `/` — Public home page (search, news, statistics)
- `/workspace/[username]/home/[[...path]]` — File browser for user workspaces
- `/services/(genomics|metagenomics|phylogenomics|protein-tools|utilities|viral-tools)/...` — Bioinformatics service submission forms (route groups as categories)
- `/search/` — Global search
- `/jobs/` — Job monitoring
- `/api/auth/...` — Custom auth API routes (sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, session, etc.)
- `/api/services/...` — Proxied service API routes
- `/api/workspace/...` — Proxied workspace API routes

**Auth system (`src/lib/auth-client.ts`, `src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`)**

- Custom BV-BRC auth built on the `better-auth` library (`src/lib/auth.ts`) for stateless session management; `auth-client.ts` exposes a `bvbrcAuth` client object with a better-auth-style API
- Auth state lives in `AuthContext`, hydrated from `user_profile` and `user_id` cookies on the server
- Protected routes: `/services/*` and `/workspace/*` — middleware in `src/proxy.ts` checks for `bvbrc_token` + `bvbrc_user_id` cookies
- When applicable, use the better-auth stateless functions for auth operations

**Backend communication**

- `JsonRpcClient` (`src/lib/jsonrpc-client.ts`) — All backend calls use JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP POST; requires `APP_SERVICE_URL` env var
- `AppService` (`src/lib/app-service.ts`) — Job management: enumerate/query/kill jobs, submit services via `AppService.start_app2`
- `WorkspaceApiClient` (`src/lib/services/workspace/client.ts`) — Workspace CRUD operations

**Workspace browser (`src/components/workspace/`)**

- `workspace-browser.tsx` — Main orchestrator; combines file listing, sorting, breadcrumbs, toolbar, dialogs, and resizable panels
- `workspace-data-table.tsx` — TanStack Table-based file listing with virtual scrolling
- Details panel uses `react-resizable-panels` with state in `WorkspacePanelContext`
- Favorites stored in `favorites.json` workspace file, loaded via `loadFavorites()`

**Services pattern**

- Each bioinformatics service is a form page under `/services/`
- Forms use TanStack Form (`@tanstack/react-form`) + zod validation
- Submission goes through `useServiceFormSubmission` hook → `submitServiceJob()` → `AppService.start_app2`
- `ServiceDebuggingProvider` wraps service layouts; enables a debug mode that shows params instead of submitting

**Rerun pre-fill pattern**

- `useRerunForm<T>()` reads job params from `sessionStorage` (keyed by `?rerun_key=`) and returns `{ rerunData }`
- Pre-fill is auto-applied via the hook's declarative options (`fields`, `libraries`, `syncLibraries`, `onApply`); the hook self-manages one-shot application internally
- The sessionStorage entry is intentionally NOT consumed on read — `<AuthBoundary>`'s Suspense fallback can mount the form twice during hydration, so a consume-on-read would null out the second mount
- Library reconstruction helpers in `src/lib/rerun-utility.ts`:
  - `buildPairedLibraries(rerunData, getExtra?)` — paired-end libs from `paired_end_libs`
  - `buildSingleLibraries(rerunData, getExtra?)` — single-end libs from `single_end_libs`
  - `buildSraLibraries(rerunData)` — SRA libs from `srr_libs` with `srr_ids` fallback
  - Pass a `getExtra` callback to merge service-specific fields (e.g. `platform`, `interleaved`)

**Data fetching**

- TanStack Query for all async state (client-side)
- Custom hooks in `src/hooks/services/workspace/` wrap workspace API calls
- `useAuthenticatedFetch` hook wraps fetch with cookie credentials and 401 refresh logic

**UI**

- shadcn/ui (New York style, slate base) in `src/components/ui/`
- All shadcn/ui components are using the @base-ui primitives (ex: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/accordion)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variable theming; multiple named themes in `src/app/globals.css`
- SVG imports handled via `@svgr/webpack` (use `import Icon from './file.svg'` or `'./file.svg?url'` for raw URL)
- `sonner` for toast notifications; `lucide-react` for icons

### Path aliases

- Imports to `src/` should use the `@/` alias.
- Imports to `public/` should use the `@public/` alias.

### Key type files

- `src/types/workspace.ts` — Job/RPC types
- `src/types/workspace-browser.ts` — `WorkspaceBrowserItem`, `SortField`, etc.
- `src/app/api/auth/types.ts` — `AuthUser`, `UserProfile`, credential types

### Naming Variables

- All variables and constants use `camelCase` — including module-level `const` exports. Do not use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (that is a C/Java convention, not TypeScript/JavaScript).
- The only exceptions are environment variable names (OS convention) and zod schema objects which conventionally use camelCase anyway.

### Code organisation

- Module-level constants and types that are used by a service page belong in that service's `*-form-utils.ts` file, not inline in the page component. Export them and import into the page.

### Git

- Do NOT automatically try to commit changes unless it was specified to do so. All changes need to be reviewed manually before blindly commiting them.

### Plans

- When creating plans, ensure that a .md file is also created in /plans to ensure proper documentation.

### Error Handling

- Do NOT use generic errors for errors. The original error message should still be displayed.
- If the original error is too long, condense it but ensure the error still remains the same,

### E2E Testing (Playwright)

- Playwright specs live under `/e2e/`. See `/e2e/README.md` for the full runbook.
- Do **not** duplicate Vitest coverage. Playwright is only for multi-page journeys, cross-browser parity, and jsdom-impossible interactions (file upload, drag/drop, 3D viewer, visual regressions).
- All `/api/**` and outbound HTTPS to BV-BRC/PATRIC/TheSEED/NCBI are mocked via `e2e/mocks/backends.ts` (HAR replay + JSON overrides). Never depend on a live backend in the suite that runs in CI.
- The `plugin:playwright` MCP server is available to agents for interactive browser driving. Start `pnpm dev` and `browser_navigate` to `http://localhost:3019`.
- Visual regression: strict on Chromium, tolerant on Firefox/WebKit. Update baselines with `pnpm e2e:update-snapshots` and review the PNG diffs in the PR.
