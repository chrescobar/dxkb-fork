# DXKB Accessibility Manual Checklist

Automated tests (axe-core + scripted keyboard/focus) cover ~35–40% of WCAG 2.1 AA criteria.
This checklist covers the remaining criteria that require human judgment.

Run this checklist before any release that touches **nav, modals, data tables, charts, or animated surfaces**.

## WCAG 1.4.13 — Content on Hover or Focus

Tooltips, hover cards, and popover content that appears on hover or focus must be:

- [ ] **Dismissible** — pressing Escape hides the tooltip/hover content without moving focus.
- [ ] **Hoverable** — the user can move the pointer onto the revealed content without it disappearing.
- [ ] **Persistent** — the content stays visible long enough to read (no auto-dismiss in < 3s on hover).

**Surfaces to check:**
- Toolbar icon buttons (Refresh, New Folder, Upload) in the workspace browser
- Chart legend pills in the Metadata Distributions section of organism pages
- Column header sort indicators in the data table
- Job status badges in the jobs list

## WCAG 1.3.5 — Identify Input Purpose

Form inputs that collect personal user data must have an `autocomplete` attribute set to the correct [autofill detail token](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill-detail-tokens).

- [ ] Sign-in form: `email` field has `autocomplete="email"`, `password` has `autocomplete="current-password"`.
- [ ] Sign-up form: `email` has `autocomplete="email"`, password has `autocomplete="new-password"`.
- [ ] Settings profile fields: name fields use `autocomplete="given-name"` / `autocomplete="family-name"`.

---

## WCAG 2.5.3 — Label in Name

The visible label text of interactive elements must be contained in (or match) the accessible name.

- [ ] Toolbar buttons whose icon is the visible label: verify the `aria-label` starts with or exactly matches the visible tooltip text.
- [ ] Command palette search input: the visible placeholder matches the accessible name / label.
- [ ] Chart legend toggles: the visible pill text matches the button's accessible name (check with axe too — axe covers 2.5.3 via `label-content-name-mismatch`).

## Screen-reader announcement quality

Axe does not verify that announcements are *useful*, only that they exist. Use a real screen reader (VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA on Windows) for the following surfaces:

- [ ] **Workspace file table** — row selection, single/multi-select state, file details panel opening.
  - Expected: "N items selected", file name + type announced on selection, panel heading announced on open.
- [ ] **Jobs list** — status column values should be announced as plain text ("completed", "failed"), not as icon-only.
- [ ] **Command palette** — dialog open/close announcement, item count, focused item name.
- [ ] **Toast notifications (sonner)** — toast content must be announced via an `aria-live` region. Verify with VoiceOver by triggering a file upload success or error.
- [ ] **Data table sort** — after clicking a column header, the sort direction change ("ascending"/"descending") is announced.
- [ ] **Taxonomy charts (Metadata Distributions)** — chart containers must have an accessible title (or `aria-labelledby`) so screen-reader users know what each chart depicts.

---

## WCAG 2.4.6 — Headings and Labels (descriptive)

Automated tools verify heading hierarchy but not content quality.

- [ ] Each page has a unique, descriptive `<h1>` that describes the page's purpose (not just "DXKB").
- [ ] Section headings in long pages (About, FAQ, Publications) are descriptive enough to navigate by heading.
- [ ] Form field labels are descriptive: "Output folder" not just "Folder"; "Read 1 (FASTQ)" not just "File 1".

---

## WCAG 2.4.7 — Focus Visible (enhanced — WCAG 2.2 AA)

The automated keyboard spec checks for outline/box-shadow presence but cannot judge visual prominence.

- [ ] Focused elements are clearly visible against both **light** and **dark** themes.
- [ ] Focused elements within data tables and the command palette have visible rings (the dark theme's ring colour must meet 3:1 contrast against adjacent background).

---

## WCAG 1.4.4 — Resize Text (200%)

- [ ] Browse the app at 200% browser zoom. Verify text does not overflow containers or become truncated without a way to read it.
- [ ] The workspace file name column should show an ellipsis with a tooltip or full expansion available.

## How to run a manual pass

1. Install [axe DevTools browser extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) for quick supplemental scans.
2. Enable VoiceOver (macOS: `Cmd + F5`) or NVDA (Windows: free download from nvaccess.org).
3. Navigate each surface by **keyboard only**: Tab, Shift+Tab, arrow keys, Enter, Space, Escape.
4. Check every item above; file GitHub issues for failures tagged `a11y`.
5. Record the date and your browser/OS in the issue description.
