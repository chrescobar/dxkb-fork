# Phylogeny integration

DXKB's taxonomy Phylogeny view supports two renderers. Archaeopteryx renders phyloXML directly in the application. Auspice is built as a separate same-origin client and runs in an iframe at `/nextstrain-viewer/<dataset-id>`.

## Data flow

Bacterial trees: the browser asks `/api/phylogeny/bacterial-trees/<taxonId>` for the taxon's phyloXML filename, then downloads that file from BV-BRC itself. The route answers from `src/lib/phylogeny/bacterial-tree-index.ts`, which downloads BV-BRC's `taxon_tree_dict.json` (~32 MB; 499,508 taxa mapped to 2,900 files) once per server process and refreshes it in the background after 24 h. The browser used to download that dictionary itself under a 2 s timeout, which failed on connections slower than ~17 Mbit/s. `PHYLO_TREE_DICTIONARY_URL` overrides the source; E2E points it at the loopback mock.

Viral family JSON advertises Archaeopteryx and Nextstrain choices. Advertised Nextstrain choices are enabled when `/api/phylogeny/nextstrain-datasets` confirms that the corresponding BV-BRC dataset exists, or when an optional local fallback contains a renderable copy. Inventory loading or failure is shown separately from confirmed dataset absence.

Auspice calls the local Charon-compatible routes under `/api/charon`, which fetch from BV-BRC first and fall back to the optional local store when the remote dataset is missing or unavailable. Dataset IDs are canonical slash-separated identifiers; main files in the fallback directory use the same segments joined by underscores and a `.json` suffix. Sidecars use the supported `_tip-frequencies`, `_root-sequence`, and `_measurements` suffixes. Because those suffixes are indistinguishable from a real final ID segment of the same name, `tip-frequencies`, `root-sequence`, and `measurements` are reserved and rejected as a dataset ID's final segment (`parseDatasetId`/`canonicalDatasetId`) — a main dataset must not be named after a sidecar.

## Archaeopteryx

`src/lib/phylogeny/archaeopteryx.ts` lazy-loads Archaeopteryx.js 3.x with d3 v7, `archaeopteryx/forester` and phyloxml, publishing each on `window` first: the bundler cannot resolve the guarded `require()` calls in the library's UMD header, so the bundled viewer reads its dependencies from page globals. PNG and PDF downloads appear only when `window.Canvg` (canvg 4) and `window.jspdf` with svg2pdf.js are present, so the loader publishes those too. jQuery, jQuery UI and FileSaver are no longer used.

- `launch(container, tree, config)` takes one config object and throws on any unknown key. `createViewerConfig` is the only place DXKB builds it, and its unit tests launch the real viewer with it. Bacterial trees enable leaf selection; viral trees open on the `Host` visualization, which the viewer replaces with its own choice (logging a warning) when too few tips carry it.
- `collectNodeLabels` offers a label checkbox for each node property. Archaeopteryx concatenates those labels and keys into the control panel's HTML without escaping, so only property keys matching `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` are offered. Upstream escapes tooltip, dialog and menu text itself.
- The viewer keeps one instance per page in module state, and every handle's `destroy()` tears down whichever viewer is current. `mountArchaeopteryx` makes a replaced handle's `destroy()` a no-op.
- Theme: 3.x has no background or label color options. `seedViewerTheme` writes the site's light/dark choice to `localStorage["aptx-panel-theme"]` before launch; `syncViewerTheme` clicks the viewer's own theme switch (hidden in `src/styles/archaeopteryx-theme.css`) when `data-theme` changes, which keeps zoom, selection and searches. The same stylesheet maps the viewer's `--p-*` custom properties and the canvas background to DXKB tokens.
- Control panel: `ArchaeopteryxPhylogeny` launches it collapsed to its header bar when the tree host is 640px wide or less. It measures the host, not the viewport, because the leaf-details side panel can take up to 60% of a wide screen. When a resize takes the host across that width, `setViewerControlsCollapsed` clicks the viewer's own hide/show button. Narrowing folds the panel. Widening reopens it only if narrowing folded it, so a panel the user opened or closed in between stays as they left it.
- No local patch is applied. The retired `archaeopteryx@2.3.2` patch escaped tooltip, dialog, option and checkbox HTML; namespaced and removed its page listeners; added `destroy()` and `setTheme()`; and awaited canvg for PNG export. 3.x does all of that itself except the checkbox escaping and the theme API, which `collectNodeLabels` and the theme helpers above replace. phyloxml 1.1.0 likewise ships the `require('sax')` fix the retired `phyloxml@1.0.0` patch carried.

## Deployment

`NEXTSTRAIN_DATASET_DIR` is optional. Leave it unset for the default remote-only configuration. Set it to an absolute, readable directory only when the deployment should use local datasets as a fallback for BV-BRC misses or outages. A configured but unreadable directory is treated as a deployment error.

When a local fallback is provisioned, run `pnpm check:nextstrain-datasets`. It reconciles family advertisements with the exact validation policy used by runtime inventory, including filename validity, sidecar exclusion, realpath containment, regular-file status, JSON parsing, and supported Auspice v2 shapes. Use `--strict` when missing advertised fallback datasets must fail a deployment gate; unadvertised valid local datasets remain warnings.

`pnpm build:auspice` creates `public/dist` and `public/nextstrain-viewer.html`. The build retains third-party `.LICENSE.txt` notices and removes only unserved precompressed files and the copied `dist/index.html`. Its content hash covers the build script, Auspice config/navbar, package metadata, lockfile, and Auspice patches. Clean CI requires restored output or a cache keyed by those inputs before the local skip can save work.

Standalone deployments must include `public/dist`, `public/nextstrain-viewer.html`, `public/auspice-dark.css`, and `public/auspice-favicon.png`.

## Licensing and attribution

Auspice is AGPL-3.0. Releases must provide the corresponding Auspice source and DXKB build-time customizations as required by that license. Complete this source-availability review as a release requirement rather than assuming npm package availability alone is sufficient.

Keep the visible "Powered by Nextstrain" attribution and the configured CARTO/OpenStreetMap tile attribution. Retain generated third-party license notices unless legal review approves another distribution mechanism.
