# E2E (Playwright)

Browser-driven end-to-end tests for DXKB V2. Complements the 134 Vitest files under `src/**` — Vitest still covers units, hooks, contexts, API routes, and auth internals. Playwright covers what jsdom can't: real browser rendering across Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, multi-page journeys with real cookies, file upload/drag-drop, 3D viewers, and visual regressions.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm e2e                       # Run all specs against all three browsers
pnpm e2e --project=chromium    # Run one browser
pnpm e2e:ui                    # Open Playwright UI runner
pnpm e2e:debug                 # Open the inspector
pnpm e2e:codegen               # Record selectors against a running app
pnpm e2e:report                # Open last HTML report
pnpm e2e:update-snapshots      # Regenerate visual baselines
pnpm e2e:record <journey>      # Record a HAR against live backend (manual, local only)
```

The suite runs against a **production build** on port `3020` (independent from `pnpm dev` on 3019 and `pnpm start` on 3010). Playwright's `webServer` config starts `next start -p 3020` automatically; it does **not** build the app for you. Run `pnpm build` before `pnpm e2e` after any source change. The `pnpm e2e` script in `package.json` wires this together; CI runs `pnpm build` as a separate workflow step for the same reason.

Override the port with `E2E_PORT=3030 pnpm e2e --project=chromium`. The wrapper substitutes `${E2E_PORT}` in every backend URL in `.env.e2e.test` so server-side fetches still reach the correct loopback mock.

## Mocking strategy

All `/api/**` and outbound HTTPS to `*.patricbrc.org`, `*.bv-brc.org`, `*.theseed.org`, `*.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` are mocked. Two layers are registered into the Playwright routing stack so LIFO precedence gives overrides the first shot:

1. **JSON overrides** (`e2e/fixtures/overrides/*`) — hand-written responses plus body-aware overrides generated from recorded HARs. Highest precedence.
2. **Strict guard** — any backend request not matched by an override is aborted with `route.abort("failed")` and logged as `[applyBackendMocks/strict]` to the test output.

Non-backend requests (Next.js assets, fonts, CDN) always pass through regardless of strict mode.

Call `applyBackendMocks(page, { overrides })` in a `beforeEach`. **Strict is the default.** If you genuinely need to let real backend calls through for an exploratory test, pass `strict: false`.

`emptyBackendFallbackOverrides` (from `e2e/fixtures/overrides`) covers `/api/auth/`, `/api/services/`, `/api/workspace/` with generic, data-free 200 responses — spread it last in your override list so it answers anything a more specific override in your list didn't. It never returns named business data, so it's safe to include in any spec regardless of what that spec is testing.

#### Canonical fixture records (`e2e/fixtures/overrides/catchall.ts`)

The populated business-entity fixtures inside `catchall.ts` (genome, taxonomy, epitope, experiment, surveillance, serology, protein structure, etc.) are built from typed, dependency-free records in `src/lib/e2e-fixtures/records.ts` and wrapped per-transport by `src/lib/e2e-fixtures/envelopes.ts`. The **same** records back the server-side loopback mock (`src/app/api/e2e-mock/[...path]/route.ts`) — before this module existed, each layer hand-rolled its own copy and they drifted (e.g. epitope `host_name` was an array in one file and a bare string in the other). `src/lib/e2e-fixtures/__tests__/records.test.ts` parses every record with the production Zod schemas from `src/lib/data-api/schemas.ts`. `src/lib/e2e-fixtures/__tests__/transport-parity.test.ts` calls the real server-side `route.ts` handler and compares its response against the real, statically-defined bodies in the matching `catchall.ts` bundle — it imports `catchall.ts` directly (a type-only `import type` keeps the Playwright runtime out of that import chain, so this works fine from a Vitest test). For each of the 7 resources it covers, it diffs the gateway GET entry, the gateway POST entry (except `genome`'s, which is a dynamic function, not a static literal), and the e2e-mock loopback GET entry where one exists with real data (`experiment`, `surveillance`, `serology`) — see the test file's own doc comment for the exact per-resource breakdown. A future edit that re-inlines a diverging literal into any of those covered call sites fails loudly instead of drifting silently.

`records.ts` also owns the fixtures that are not `/api/data` resources: the BV-BRC *website* API tables `organismTaxonomyRecords` and `organismSummaryRecords` (keyed by taxon id, the pair behind every organism landing page and `/taxonomy/<id>`), the Brucella PPI rows and their collection total, and a `genome_amr` row. The two organism tables are kept 1:1 and their counts kept in agreement by `records.test.ts` — a taxon present in one and missing from the other renders half a page, which is exactly how `/taxonomy/1763` used to reach the framework error boundary.

**Import boundary.** `src/lib/e2e-fixtures/**` may only be imported from `src/lib/e2e-fixtures/**`, `src/app/api/e2e-mock/**`, and `e2e/fixtures/overrides/**`. A `no-restricted-imports` zone in `eslint.config.mjs` enforces it and `src/__tests__/e2e-fixtures-import-boundary.test.ts` pins the allowlist against the files that actually import the module, in both directions. `server-only` is deliberately not used: Playwright's own Node process imports the override bundles that re-export these records.

`catchall.ts` exports two kinds of things — import the most specific one your spec needs:

- **`emptyBackendFallbackOverrides`** — generic, data-free responses (`/api/auth/`, `/api/services/`, `/api/workspace/`). Safe anywhere; never returns named business data a test didn't ask for.
- **Named resource scenario bundles** — one per resource (`genomeScenarioOverrides`, `epitopeScenarioOverrides`, `taxonomyScenarioOverrides`, `experimentScenarioOverrides`, `biosetScenarioOverrides`, `surveillanceScenarioOverrides`, `serologyScenarioOverrides`, `proteinStructureScenarioOverrides`, `proteinFeatureScenarioOverrides`, `genomeFeatureScenarioOverrides`, `genomeSequenceScenarioOverrides`, `strainScenarioOverrides`, `epitopeAssayScenarioOverrides`). Every journey/view/smoke/visual spec in the suite imports the specific bundle(s) it actually exercises, plus `emptyBackendFallbackOverrides` for everything else, instead of a blanket catch-all.
- **`taxonomyTreeScenarioOverrides`** — the one named bundle scoped to a *boundary* rather than a resource. The Taxa Tree reads from its own same-origin route (`/api/taxonomy-tree/children` and `/api/taxonomy-tree/child-counts`), not from `/api/data/taxonomy`, so `taxonomyScenarioOverrides` does not cover it. The bundle is data-free (`{rows: []}` / `{counts: {}}`), so it is what a spec imports when it mounts the tree *incidentally* and only needs the strict guard satisfied — that guard aborts an unmocked `/api/**` request and fails the test on teardown (`e2e/tests/organisms/all.spec.ts` and the a11y sweep use it this way). A spec that exercises the tree itself does not import this bundle: it supplies its own content-bearing entries for both operations, since an empty `{rows}`/`{counts}` earlier in the list would win under first-match ordering and leave every node a leaf. See `e2e/tests/taxonomy-tree.spec.ts`.

`namedResourceScenarioOverrides` and `apiCatchallOverrides` compose all the named bundles (± the empty fallback) as internal, unexported building blocks — nothing outside `catchall.ts` imports them. **`a11yBackendOverrides`** is the one broad, unscoped aggregate this module exports (every named bundle + the empty fallback + external-host stubs), reserved for the accessibility sweep (`e2e/tests/a11y/*.spec.ts`), which scans dozens of routes spanning every resource type in one pass. Do not import it outside `e2e/tests/a11y/`.

### Server-side backends: loopback isolation

`page.route()` only intercepts _browser_ requests. Server components and API route handlers make their own outbound fetches to `APP_SERVICE_URL`, `WORKSPACE_API_URL`, `USER_URL`, etc. before the page is streamed, and those fetches bypass Playwright entirely — previously they failed with "JSON-RPC call failed: HTTP error! status: 500" and flooded the webServer log on every render.

To fix this the test server runs through a wrapper that seeds the right env vars before Next starts:

- **`e2e/scripts/start-webserver.mjs`** is what `playwright.config.ts`'s `webServer.command` launches. It resolves the port (CLI arg > `E2E_PORT` > `3020`), then reads `.env.e2e.local` (optional) followed by `.env.e2e.test` (required) via `node:util`'s `parseEnv`, merging each key into `process.env` under `node --env-file=` semantics (existing values win). Values can reference `${E2E_PORT}`; the wrapper substitutes the resolved port at load time so the committed file stays port-agnostic. Finally it spawns `next start -p <port>` — it does **not** run `next build`, because a cold build exceeds Playwright's webServer timeout and blocks targeted runs. Run `pnpm build` yourself first. We can't just use `node --env-file=` here because that flag leaks into `NODE_OPTIONS` and Next's build worker threads reject `NODE_OPTIONS` containing `--env-file` (`ERR_WORKER_INVALID_EXEC_ARGV`).
- **`.env.e2e.test`** (committed, loaded by the wrapper) points every backend URL at a loopback mock: `http://127.0.0.1:${E2E_PORT}/api/e2e-mock/<service>`.
- **`.env.e2e.local`** (gitignored, loaded by the wrapper if present) is for local-only overrides. Because the wrapper loads `.env.e2e.local` **before** `.env.e2e.test`, any key set in the local file wins over the committed default. A shell-exported variable beats both.
- **`src/app/api/e2e-mock/[...path]/route.ts`** answers those loopback requests, and its dispatch is **fail-closed**. Every path / JSON-RPC-method combination it serves is named in the module; anything else gets a `400` whose `reason` says exactly what is missing, and the same reason is written to the webServer log as `[api/e2e-mock] e2e-mock: …`. So `grep '\[api/e2e-mock\] e2e-mock: ' <playwright output>` is how you find out whether a run hit a fixture gap. Every rejection carries that prefix **by construction**: callers pass a label, never a whole `error` string, and `rejectionError()` builds it — the JSON-RPC branch included, which answers with an error envelope rather than that body. Two kinds of non-2xx deliberately stay outside the prefix, because they are fixture behaviour rather than gaps and folding them in would make the grep useless: the `E2E_MOCK_ENABLED` guard's 404, and `identity.ts`'s 401/404 for bad credentials and an unknown user. Only the 401s are asserted by a spec (`auth.spec.ts`); the 404 is a catch-all for any unrecognised `user/<id>`, so it doubles as the fixture gap for a profile this mock does not model. That is harmless today because `getProfile` is only ever called for the session user, but a spec that seeds a second user would hit a real gap this grep cannot see. `route.test.ts` pins both halves — one test drives all eight rejection branches through the prefix, and a second scans the route module's source so a new branch cannot answer 4xx on its own without failing. It never answers an unknown request with an empty success — a silent `{}` renders a real page with no data, so a spec passes asserting nothing (or, as `/taxonomy/1763` did, renders an error boundary that gets recorded as a page defect). Hits are logged as `[api/e2e-mock] <METHOD> /<path><query>`.
  - `GET` — identity, `phylo-manifest`, `phylo-tree-dictionary`, the `bvbrc-website` taxonomy/summary/genome fixtures, and the `data/<core>` Solr fixtures.
  - `POST` — `bvbrc-website/genome_amr` (with body validation), the identity endpoints, and the four JSON-RPC calls in `loopbackRpcResults` (`workspace` → `Workspace.ls` / `Workspace.get`; `app-service` → `AppService.query_task_summary_filtered` / `query_app_summary_filtered`). Those four answer empty, each with a comment stating why empty is the correct answer for that contract; they are the only combinations an instrumented run of the full Chromium suite plus `pnpm a11y` observed reaching the loopback.
  - `PUT` / `DELETE` — nothing. The same instrumented run recorded no PUT or DELETE reaching the handler at all.
- The handler is guarded by `E2E_MOCK_ENABLED=1` (set in `.env.e2e.test`). Without that flag every handler returns 404, so a production build that somehow shipped this file can't serve fake data.

If you add a new server-side backend dependency, add its env var to `.env.e2e.test` pointing at `/api/e2e-mock/<something>` **and** register the path (and, for JSON-RPC, the method) in `route.ts`. The env var alone is no longer enough: the handler is fail-closed, so an unregistered call gets a `400` naming itself rather than a silent success. That failure is the point — it tells you which fixture to write.

Do not infer from a green browser-side run that the loopback is complete. `page.route()` cannot see a Server Component's fetch, and `emptyBackendFallbackOverrides` deliberately swallows broad auth/services/workspace families before they leave the page. The two accommodations are separate: the browser-side empty fallback exists so a spec need not declare traffic it does not care about; the loopback has no equivalent and must not grow one.

## Page objects

`e2e/pages/` holds thin wrappers around the selectors and interactions for each major page. Import from `../pages` and drive the page through the wrapper rather than re-finding selectors in every spec:

```ts
import { SignInPage } from "../pages";

const signIn = new SignInPage(page);
await signIn.goto("/workspace"); // goto with optional redirect=
await signIn.fill(username, password);
await signIn.submit();
await signIn.expectInlineError(/invalid/i);
```

Add a new page object when a spec starts repeating the same selector tuple twice, not preemptively — the wrappers are meant to encode the actual shape of the page, not a speculative surface.

A part that several pages render is its own small object, composed into each page object that has it rather than duplicated: `PanelSplit` (the resizable main/details split) is `WorkspacePage.panels` and `JobsListPage.panels`, and `ViewNavRail` (the collapsible view rail) is `OrganismLandingPage.viewNav` and `TaxonPage.viewNav`. `FolderPickerDialog` is the workspace folder picker any service form's Output Folder field opens; its `pressAndTrace` records the strip's scroll position and width frame by frame, for asserting the motion. It steps the frames inside the page rather than waiting for the browser to draw them, because headless WebKit on Linux can take longer than the whole glide to draw one frame of the dialog.

Prefer role locators (`getByRole`) for anything inside a Suspense boundary on a streamed page. React can render a boundary's content in place while its hidden staged copy (`<div hidden id="S:n">` at the end of `<body>`) is still waiting for the queued reveal script to remove it. Role locators skip hidden subtrees, but CSS, `getByTestId`, `getByText` and `getByPlaceholder` locators match them, so a strict assertion briefly sees two elements, and a strict-mode violation fails at once rather than retrying. That flaked `OrganismLandingPage.getKpi` about once in 80 runs under parallel load, and failed most WebKit visits to `/sign-in?redirect=…` through `SignInPage`. When a non-role locator is unavoidable, add `.filter({ visible: true })`.

## Recording a HAR

`pnpm e2e:record <journey>` captures real backend traffic into `e2e/fixtures/hars/<journey>.har`. Specs convert recorded entries into body-aware JSON overrides with `harOverridesFor()` so they assert against the real BV-BRC response shape rather than hand-maintained mocks. Two recording modes:

**Scripted (preferred — used by the bi-weekly refresh workflow):** drop a driver at `e2e/scripts/journeys/<name>.ts` exporting `drive(page, env)` (see `e2e/scripts/journeys/README.md`). The recorder runs it headless against `E2E_RECORD_BASE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:3010`, the production build). Use this when you want determinism — the same driver records the same flow every time, which is what makes the cron'd refresh meaningful.

**Interactive (one-off exploration):** if no driver file exists for the journey name, the recorder launches a headed Chromium and waits for you to drive the flow manually, then press Enter.

Steps:

1. `cp .env.e2e.example .env.e2e` and fill in valid BV-BRC creds (gitignored — never commit).
2. `pnpm build && pnpm start` — recording uses the production build to avoid development-only HMR traffic and keep HAR output deterministic.
3. `pnpm e2e:record workspace-browse` (or your journey name).
4. The recorder filters non-backend traffic (skips `_next/static`, fonts, images), scrubs the live username/password/email out of all bodies, and rewrites the recorded host to `http://e2e-har-replay.local`. `harOverridesFor()` matches recorded paths rather than origins, so HARs remain portable across `E2E_PORT` values.
5. Commit the resulting `.har`. Re-record when the API contract drifts; the bi-weekly cron does this automatically (see below).

### Wiring a HAR into a spec

**Body-aware journey replay (`harOverridesFor` helper).** Reads the HAR file and emits one `JsonOverride` per `(path, method, JSON-RPC method)` tuple, with `matchBody` fanning the JSON-RPC entry point out by request `method` field. Sequential entries that share a tuple replay in HAR order via the override's `callIndex` body function — so a `Workspace.ls` recorded twice (pre- and post-upload) replays correctly. Use this when the spec drives a signed-in journey (workspace listing, file viewer, jobs page, service form) and asserts on UI rendered from the recorded post-auth payloads.

```ts
import { harOverridesFor } from "../scripts/har-overrides";

await applyBackendMocks(page, {
  overrides: [
    // Endpoint-specific profile and mutation responses used by this journey.
    // Signed-in identity itself comes from the production-named cookies and
    // server-side profile validation.
    ...authSessionOverrides,
    ...harOverridesFor("workspace-browse.har"),
    // No fallback layered on top — not `emptyBackendFallbackOverrides`, not a
    // broad aggregate. `emptyBackendFallbackOverrides` answers `/api/workspace/`
    // with `{items: []}`, which is exactly the traffic this replay's strict-mode
    // canary watches; layering it here would turn a loud unmocked-request
    // failure (missing HAR coverage) into a silent empty-state timeout instead.
  ],
});

// Recorded paths key off the realm the recorder authenticated against (`bvbrc`),
// not the mocked-cookie realm (`patricbrc.org`). Match the recorded path so the
// workspace browser's outbound RPC calls land on the recorded entries; cookies
// just satisfy the middleware existence check.
await page.goto(`/workspace/${encodeURIComponent("e2e-test-user@bvbrc")}/home`);
```

`harOverridesFor` matches on `pathname + search`, so the host-placeholder rewrite (`http://e2e-har-replay.local`) is irrelevant; the override matcher does a substring `includes` check against the live request URL. Status and response headers are taken from the first entry of each group; if a journey needs status drift across same-key calls, layer hand-rolled overrides on top.

### Bi-weekly refresh

`.github/workflows/e2e-har-refresh.yml` runs the scripted recorders against the live backend on a fortnightly cron and opens a `chore(e2e): refresh recorded HARs` PR if any HAR diffed. Real shape changes (new fields, renamed keys, status drift) surface as a normal review; pure timestamp churn merges as-is. Required secrets: `E2E_TEST_USER`, `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD`, `E2E_HAR_REFRESH_TOKEN` (PAT with `contents:write` + `pull-requests:write`).

The workflow has two matrix groups:

- **read-only** (cron + manual dispatch): `workspace-browse`, `workspace-viewer`, `jobs-lifecycle`, `service-submit`. Nothing writes to the test account.
- **write** (manual dispatch with `include_write: true` only): `workspace-upload`. Each refresh creates a new file under `home/.e2e-records/` on the test account, so we keep this off the cron.

Each group opens its own PR (`chore/e2e-har-refresh-read-only` / `chore/e2e-har-refresh-write`). Some journeys depend on seeded fixtures on the test account — see [`e2e/scripts/journeys/README.md`](./scripts/journeys/README.md) for the catalogue and seeding requirements.

## Visual regression

Baselines live in `e2e/__snapshots__/`, one per `(spec, browser, platform)` triple. Chromium is strict (zero-pixel diff). Firefox and WebKit allow `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.05` to absorb font/AA differences — which also means those two engines keep passing against a materially outdated baseline, so their images need refreshing deliberately rather than when a job goes red.

We commit both `*-linux.png` (for CI on `ubuntu-latest`) and `*-darwin.png` (for local Macs) so visual tests work out of the box on both. Windows contributors regenerate their own `*-win32.png` locally and are not expected to commit them.

### Regenerate on macOS

For intentional UI changes, first refresh your local (Darwin) baselines:

```bash
pnpm e2e:update-snapshots
git add e2e/__snapshots__
```

### Regenerate Linux baselines (for CI)

**Preferred — pull from a failing CI run.** Open a PR with your UI change, let the e2e job fail on the visual diff, then download the actuals and commit them:

```bash
# Find the failed run id for your PR
gh run list --workflow="E2E (Playwright)" --branch=<your-branch> --limit 1

# Download all artifacts
gh run download <run-id> --dir /tmp/dxkb-ci

# Copy actuals into the baseline dir (adjust page/browser to match what failed)
DEST=e2e/__snapshots__/tests/visual/visual.spec.ts-snapshots
for B in chromium firefox webkit; do
  for P in home sign-in workspace genome-assembly jobs; do
    ACTUAL=$(find /tmp/dxkb-ci/playwright-report-$B -type d -name "*-snapshot-$B" \
      -exec find {} -name "$P-actual.png" \; 2>/dev/null | head -1)
    [ -n "$ACTUAL" ] && cp "$ACTUAL" "$DEST/$P-$B-linux.png"
  done
done

git add e2e/__snapshots__
```

This is the only way to get byte-exact parity with GitHub Actions runners.

**Do not** use `docker run --platform linux/amd64 mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:X-noble …` on Apple Silicon. QEMU emulation produces ~20-24 px height differences and ~6% pixel drift vs native amd64, which busts chromium's zero-tolerance. The image works on a native amd64 host (EC2, GitHub Codespaces) if you have one.

Review the PNG diffs in the PR before merging.

### A `pkg.version` bump reddens every full-page chromium snapshot

`next.config.ts` inlines `package.json`'s version as `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` and `src/components/navbars/desktop-navbar.tsx` renders it as a `v0.0.0` badge. The badge's glyph advance widths change with the digits, which shifts every navbar item to the left of the flex-grown search box by about a pixel — roughly 2100-2400 differing pixels on any `fullPage` snapshot, which chromium's zero tolerance rejects.

So a version bump alone turns the chromium visual job red for a change nobody made to the UI. That is expected, not a regression: refresh the baselines (`-darwin` locally, `-linux` from the failing CI run) as part of the bump. If this becomes tiresome, the fix is to pin `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` for the E2E build — masking the badge does not work, because the items to its right still shift when its intrinsic width changes.

### Adjudicating a drift: the failure's pixel count is not the region list

`toHaveScreenshot` counts pixels through pixelmatch at `threshold: 0.2`, which ignores differences below roughly a greyscale delta of 53. A change can therefore repaint most of the page and contribute **zero** to the reported count. When the `#ffffff` → `#f7f7f7` page background landed, it changed 636,261 px on `sign-in` and 557,125 px on `genome-assembly` — over half of each image — and Playwright reported 2450 and 3501 differing pixels, none of them the background.

When you adjudicate a drift, enumerate the regions from an **exact** byte comparison of baseline vs actual (a histogram of `oldColor -> newColor` transitions finds the sub-threshold ones immediately), not from the failure message. Treating the reported count as the region list is how a full-page repaint gets waved through as "a few pixels of text AA". The same trap is worse on firefox and webkit, whose `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.05` hides perceptible changes too.

### `--update-snapshots=all` ignores tolerance

`=all` rewrites every baseline the run touches, **including ones that were passing** — which on firefox and webkit means ones that were passing inside `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.05`. That is how an image nobody adjudicated ends up rewritten alongside the ones they did.

A bare `--update-snapshots` does **not** do this: Playwright's default preset is `changed`, which rewrites only the baselines whose comparison fails. So `pnpm e2e:update-snapshots` is the safe form, and `=all` is an explicit opt-in to overwriting images you never looked at. Reach for it only once you have adjudicated every image in the selection.

### The baseline sets are not in step, per file

Refreshing one platform and not the other leaves a baseline that disagrees with head on the platform you skipped, and — at chromium's zero tolerance — a red job for the next person. When a change requires new baselines, refresh **both** sets in the same PR: `-darwin` locally, `-linux` from that PR's failing CI run.

The committed sets are currently a patchwork. This is the measured per-file state, not a generalisation, because the generalisations are all false:

**Version badge and navbar.** The Chromium Darwin set reads `v0.5.0` (navbar `Organisms / Services / Workspace / Resources`) in every image except `jobs`, which still reads `v0.4.1`. In the WebKit Darwin set only `genome-assembly` and `workspace` were refreshed to `v0.5.0`; the other six still read `v0.4.1`, because a fresh WebKit render of each also moves some text lines by 1 px, which nobody has adjudicated. The CI bot synced the Chromium `-linux` set to `v0.5.0`. In `-firefox-darwin`, `-firefox-linux` and `-webkit-linux`, the three organism-landing images read **`v0.3.3` with the current navbar**, `genome-assembly` and `home` read `v0.2.6` (firefox-darwin) or `v0.2.7` (the other two), and `jobs` / `sign-in` / `workspace` read `v0.2.6` with a navbar whose first item is the since-removed **"Getting started"**. So of the 16 firefox images, 6 are at v0.3.3 and 7 carry the old navbar — do not assume a whole set shares one vintage.

**`home`'s statistics fixture is fixed, but four baselines still need refresh.** The Chromium and WebKit Darwin baselines now render the deterministic Taxonomy and Protein Structure totals. Refresh the Linux and Firefox Darwin baselines in native CI so every image reflects the same values; do not use Apple-Silicon/QEMU output for Linux.

**The `jobs` snapshot now waits for its two fixture rows and masks its live timestamp.** The Chromium and WebKit Darwin baselines have been refreshed to the loaded state. The Linux and Firefox Darwin baselines still predate that deterministic contract and must be refreshed in native CI; until then they can remain green under the browser-level tolerance despite showing stale content. The `jobs` layout also depends on the wall clock: the masked `Last updated: <toLocaleTimeString()>` text measures 138.75–154.16 px on macOS against its fixed 144 px (`w-36`) span, so for most times of day it wraps to two lines, grows the counts row from 28 px to 32 px and pushes the table down 4 px, which is why neither Darwin `jobs` baseline was refreshed for `v0.5.0`.

**`-webkit-darwin` is ahead of `-webkit-linux`.** Seven of the eight webkit darwin baselines were refreshed to match head; the linux set was not, and cannot be from a Mac. Both need the same CI run as firefox.

**Firefox cannot be regenerated locally at all**: `browserType.launch: Timeout 180000ms exceeded` with `sandbox_extension_issue_file_to_process … Operation not permitted`, reproducible on an untouched route. Both firefox sets need a CI run.

## Browser matrix

Every PR runs three jobs via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/pnpm-e2e.yml`): chromium, firefox, webkit. Each shard caches its own browser binary in `~/.cache/ms-playwright`. Reports upload as artifacts on failure.

## Agents: driving the app interactively

Two paths, depending on what the agent needs to do.

**Playwright MCP (preferred for exploration)** — the `plugin:playwright` MCP server is available in this repo's Claude sessions:

```text
1. Start the dev server:  pnpm dev
2. Use browser_navigate:  http://localhost:3019
3. Use browser_snapshot, browser_click, browser_type, etc.
```

**Pnpm scripts (for running the suite)** — use the `pnpm e2e*` commands above from a Bash tool.

## Cross-cutting specs

**`tests/a11y/`** — the accessibility suite does not run under `playwright.config.ts` at all (`testMatch` excludes it). It has its own configs, scripts and gate; see `e2e/a11y/README.md` for the runbook.

**`viewer-3d.spec.ts`** — drives `/viewer/structure/<path>`, mocks `/api/workspace/view/...` with a minimal one-atom PDB, and asserts the page chrome + Mol* container render. The full WebGL canvas-paint assertion is gated on Mol*'s own runtime probe — if Mol* surfaces "WebGL does not seem to be available" (e.g. headless Chromium without GPU), the paint test self-skips. Firefox and WebKit are skipped wholesale because their headless WebGL stacks are unreliable.

**`search-keyboard.spec.ts`** — covers two complementary keyboard surfaces. The navbar `SearchBar` journey: type → Enter → routed to `/search?q=...&searchtype=everything`, empty submission stays put, clipboard paste fills the input (Chromium only; Firefox / WebKit headless clipboard permissions are unreliable). The global `<CommandPalette>` mounted in the root layout: `Cmd/Ctrl+K` opens the dialog, ArrowDown + Enter routes to a navigation item, typing a query + Enter routes to `/search`, Esc closes, and clipboard paste fills the palette input.

## When to add a Playwright test vs a Vitest test

- **Vitest** for: pure functions, hooks, contexts, API route handlers, components that render fine in jsdom.
- **Playwright** for: multi-page flows, real-cookie auth, file upload, drag/drop, 3D viewer, iframes, CSS/layout regressions, cross-browser parity.

If a single render-and-assert test would pass in jsdom, keep it in Vitest. Playwright is for journeys and browser-level truth.
