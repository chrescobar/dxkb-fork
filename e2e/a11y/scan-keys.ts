/**
 * Scan keys that are deliberately NOT route-entry names.
 *
 * `baseline.generated.ts` and `reflowSkip` are keyed by scan key, and most keys
 * are route names (or `${name}/${variant.nameSuffix}`) derived from
 * `routes.ts`. These are the exceptions — surfaces a spec scans directly, which
 * therefore have no entry in the route table. The list is sanctioned rather
 * than derived because the alternative is a guard that cannot tell a renamed
 * route from a component scan, and so cannot reject either.
 *
 * `coverage.meta.spec.ts` checks every key below is still passed as a top-level
 * string literal to an `assertNoBlocking*` call in an `e2e/tests/a11y/*.spec.ts`
 * source (see {@link extractScannedKeys}), so a deleted or renamed surface
 * leaves its entry here unreferenced.
 *
 * Two limits of that check, stated so nobody has to re-derive them:
 *
 * - It does not record *which* spec scans a key, so moving a surface between
 *   a11y specs keeps its entry valid.
 * - It recognises direct string literal arguments, but not template literals,
 *   variables or concatenations. Those forms fail closed and leave the entry
 *   reported as unreferenced.
 *
 * Adding a surface is the other direction and is not enforced: an un-enumerated
 * surface only matters once someone baselines it, and the stale key message
 * says what to do at that point.
