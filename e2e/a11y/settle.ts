/**
 * Wait until the `ResizablePanelGroup` has committed its client-side layout.
 *
 * Neither networkidle nor skeleton-detach covers layout that the library's own
 * store or a *client effect* commits after the data has landed. The workspace
 * shell seeds its layout snapshot from `panelExpanded`, so a closed panel (the
 * state every load starts in) is server-rendered at 100/0 and hydrates to that
 * same split: there is no load-time collapse left to wait out. What still lands
 * late is:
 *
 *   - the separator's `aria-valuenow`, which react-resizable-panels only
 *     computes once its store has registered the group on the client;
 *   - a `ResizeObserver` callback that discards a committed layout and
 *     recomputes it from each panel's `defaultSize`;
 *   - an open panel, which the shell's `useLayoutEffect` sizes with `resize()`
 *     only after hydration (a selection or a click on Show opens it).
 *
 * All three run once the store has settled, well after the fetches go quiet.
 * The one measurement on record predates the seeding: the shell then
 * server-rendered the panel open and collapsed it in that effect, ~4.4s into
 * the load under a 20x CPU throttle, against an `awaitSettled()` that returned
 * at ~3.2s.
 *
 * Two distinct CI failures come out of that one gap, which is why this lives in
 * `settle` rather than in either spec:
 *
 *   - Scanning early catches the separator before the group has assigned it an
 *     `aria-valuenow`. The server-rendered markup carries `role="separator"`
 *     with no value, so axe's `aria-required-attr` fires `critical` on a state
 *     that is gone a few hundred ms later.
 *   - Clicking early puts `mousedown` on a toolbar button and `mouseup`
 *     wherever that button used to be, because a late layout change shifts the
 *     whole toolbar between the two (x=377 -> 1094 in the reproduction, which
 *     was the old load-time collapse; opening the panel now moves it the other
 *     way). No `click` is synthesised at all, so the dialog never opens and the
 *     failure reads as "element(s) not found" against the *dialog* — pointing
 *     away from the layout that actually caused it.
 *
 * The post-condition is the commit itself. Three conditions together stand in
 * for it, and the third is what makes the set sufficient:
 *
 *   1. Every handle carries `aria-valuenow`. react-resizable-panels computes
 *      that value from the same store update that applies a layout, so its
 *      absence means no layout has been applied yet.
 *   2. That value agrees with measured geometry — the `aria-controls` panel's
 *      share of the group's panel extent, within 1.5pp. Presence alone is the
 *      weaker claim: the library re-derives the attribute on every store
 *      update, including ones that *revert* a layout (a `ResizeObserver`
 *      callback arriving while `defaultLayoutDeferred` is still set discards
 *      the committed layout and recomputes from `defaultSize`). Agreement ties
 *      the attribute to the boxes the toolbar is actually positioned by.
 *   3. Geometry is unchanged from the previous animation frame, so a layout
 *      still in motion does not satisfy 1 and 2 mid-flight.
 *
 * Polling the group's own box would prove nothing — it spans the viewport and
 * never moves (`0,72,1280` throughout) while its children reflow underneath. A
 * fixed `extraMs` would mask both symptoms, but only while the pause happens to
 * outlast the commit.
 *
 * On a closed load the seeded 100/0 leaves nothing to reflow once the attribute
 * exists, so conditions 2 and 3 cost at most two frames there. They are not
 * dead weight: they remove the dependence on that holding, because a
 * `ResizeObserver` recompute from `defaultSize` or an open panel's
 * post-hydration `resize()` can still move the geometry after the attribute has
 * appeared.
 *
 * No-ops on pages with no panel group, so it is safe on any route.
