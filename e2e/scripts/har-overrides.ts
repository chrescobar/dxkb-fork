 * Read a HAR file and return JSON overrides that replay each recorded entry.

 * Entries are grouped by `{path+search, HTTP method, JSON-RPC method?}`. Each
 * group becomes a single override:
 *
 *  - The override URL is the path+search portion of the recorded URL, so port
 *    differences between the recorder (3010) and the live spec (E2E_PORT)
 *    don't break matching.
 *  - When the request body is a JSON-RPC envelope, `matchBody` ensures only
 *    requests carrying that RPC method are served by this override. This
 *    closes the routeFromHAR gap: routeFromHAR matches URL+method only, so
 *    four different JSON-RPC calls to `/api/services/workspace` would all
 *    serve the first matching response.
 *  - When a group has multiple entries (e.g. two `Workspace.ls` calls before
 *    and after an upload), responses are served in HAR order via the
 *    override's `callIndex` body function. Once the recorded sequence is
 *    exhausted, the last entry is served on every subsequent call so the UI
 *    isn't suddenly mocked off the air.
 *
 * Status and response headers are taken from the first entry in each group;
 * if a journey needs status drift across calls, layer hand-rolled overrides
 * on top of the HAR-derived ones in the spec.
 *
 * Pass the result into `applyBackendMocks(page, { overrides })`. The return
 * value is a plain `JsonOverride[]`, so callers can spread additional
 * fixture-specific overrides before or after for behaviour the recorder
 * couldn't capture (empty list, 500 response, etc.).
 *
 * **Canary specs that drive a HAR-replay journey should NOT layer
 * `permissiveBackendOverrides` on top.** The catch-all would silently serve
 * `{}` / `{result:[[]]}` for any drift in the HAR's coverage and the test
 * would still pass; letting the strict guard fail loudly is what surfaces
 * the missing replay so the HAR can be re-recorded. Layer endpoint-specific
 * overrides first when a journey intentionally replaces recorded responses.
 *
 * @param harPath  Absolute path or relative-to-CWD path; relative paths
 *                 resolve from `e2e/fixtures/hars/`.
