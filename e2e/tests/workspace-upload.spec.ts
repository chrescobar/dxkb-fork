// (no JSON-RPC method) so the override matches by URL+method only and serves
// the recorded response regardless of the spec's filename;
// `uploadedFilenameFromHar` recovers the recorder-generated name so re-records
// don't require parallel edits. See `harOverridesFor` for the canary rationale
// (no `permissiveBackendOverrides` here).
