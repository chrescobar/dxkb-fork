 * alert. The Taxonomy launch resolves IDs over the network before it can navigate, so
 * a chooser living inside the bar would vanish mid-flight the moment that happened —
 * no chooser, no error, no spinner. Running here puts `loadingActionIds`, the overlap
 * ref and the chooser's own state in the shell's instance, and hands the chooser back
 * as `actionDialogs` for the shell to render at section level, as a sibling of the
 * workspace rather than a descendant.
 *
 * Crossing the `md` breakpoint is *not* one of the reasons: `ResourceWorkspace` renders
 * one stable subtree at every width, so a resize re-styles the `actionBar` slot instead
 * of re-parenting it. That was not always true, and the guarantees above are what stood
