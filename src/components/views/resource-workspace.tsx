 * Detail-panel extent along the group's main axis, per layout. Stacked gets a much
 * larger share because the axis is the viewport's short one, and it cannot be dragged
 * there (the group is `disabled` and the separator is hidden below `md`).
 *
 * `panelId` is load-bearing, not decoration. `ResizablePanelGroup` caches its computed
 * layout under a key built from its panels' joined `id`s and restores that cache in
 * preference to any `defaultSize`, merely clamping it to the current `minSize`/
 * `maxSize`. A layout whose sizes change therefore has to change the key too, or the
 * first mount's split is the only one the group will ever use: crossing the breakpoint
 * would leave the detail panel clamped to `stacked.minSize` (25%) and crossing back
 * would leave the desktop panel at that same 25% instead of 15%. Changing an `id` on a
 * mounted element remounts nothing, which is what lets this coexist with the
 * one-stable-subtree contract below.
 *
 * Because the cache is per key, the two layouts also keep their splits apart: the
 * stacked layout does not inherit a share dragged along the horizontal axis (where it
 * would mean nothing), and a width the user dragged side by side is handed back when
 * they return to it. `resource-workspace.test.tsx` pins all of that as rendered
 * `flex-grow`, because a `defaultSize` assertion cannot see any of it.
 *
 * The side-by-side `defaultSize` is the user's remembered width
 * (`resourceDetailPanelSize`); 15% is only the first-visit default.

/**
 * The content / action-strip / detail-panel shell every resource view fills.
 *
 * **One element tree, in both layouts.** `children`, `actionBar` and `sidePanel` are
 * each rendered exactly once, under the same ancestors at every width; crossing
 * `narrowWorkspaceQuery` only changes props and `max-md:` classes on that stable tree.
 * That matters because `children` is typically a whole resource collection, and React
 * cannot reconcile a subtree across two different ancestor element types — returning a
 * separate narrow tree discarded the table's selection, scroll and focus, the tree's
 * expansion state, and any dialog the action bar had open, on every resize. It also
 * double-mounted every narrow page load, because `isNarrow` can only become true after
 * the effect below has read `matchMedia`.
 *
 * The one thing the layout cannot express in CSS alone is the resize axis:
 * `ResizablePanelGroup` computes drag geometry in JS and writes the main-axis extent
 * as an inline style, so `orientation` has to come from a real media-query read. It is
 * a prop on a tree that stays put, not a choice of tree.
 *
 * Hiding the detail panel — either because the consumer withdrew it (`hasSidePanel`)
 * or because the user pressed Hide — still unmounts that slot. That is the panel's
 * intended lifecycle, not the responsive defect.
