    "The Genome Annotation Service uses the RAST tool kit, <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4322359/'>RASTtk</a>, for bacteria and the <a href='https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/VIGOR4'>Viral Genome ORF Reader (VIGOR4)</a> for viruses. \
    The service accepts a FASTA formatted contig file and an annotation recipe based on taxonomy to provide an annotated genome, to provide annotation of genomic features. \
    Once the annotation process has started by clicking the “Annotate” button, the genome is queued as a “job” for the Annotation Service to process, and will increment the count in the Jobs information box \
    on the bottom right of the page. Once the annotation job has successfully completed, the output file will appear in the workspace, available for use in the BV-BRC comparative tools and/or can be downloaded if desired.",
