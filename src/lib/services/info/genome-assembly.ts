    "The bacterial Genome Assembly Service allows single or multiple assemblers to be invoked to compare results. Several assembly workflows or “strategies” are available that have been tuned to fit certain data types or desired analysis criteria such as throughput or rigor. Once the assembly process has started by clicking the Assemble button, the genome is queued as a “job” for the Assembly Service to process, and will increment the count in the Jobs information box on the bottom right of the page. Once the assembly job has successfully completed, the output file will appear in the workspace, available for use in the BV-BRC comparative tools and downloaded if desired.",
