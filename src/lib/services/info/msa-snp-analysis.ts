    "The Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)/Variation Analysis Service \
        allows users to choose an alignment algorithm to align sequences selected from: a search result, a FASTA file saved to the workspace, \
        or through simply cutting and pasting. The service can also be used for variation and SNP analysis with feature groups, FASTA files, \
        aligned FASTA files, and user input FASTA records. If a single alignment file is given, then only the variation analysis is run. \
        If multiple inputs are given, the program concatenates all sequence records and aligns them. If a mixture of protein and nucleotides \
        are given, then nucleotides are converted to proteins.",
