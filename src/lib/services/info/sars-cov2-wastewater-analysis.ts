    amplicon reads from wastewater samples. The service analyzes reads by aligning them to the reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1) \
    and then analyzes the variants in the sample using Freyja. Below is an overview of the service.",

These short, synthetic sequences of nucleotides are designed to bind (or anneal) to specific target sequences in the DNA that flank the region of interest. Once bound, primers initiate DNA amplification. The primers are specific to the target sequence. It is important to select the correct primer type and version so that the synthetic sequences can be removed from your sample.",
