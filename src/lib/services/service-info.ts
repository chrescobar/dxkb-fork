    "The BV-BRC Phylogenetic Tree Building Service enables construction of custom phylogenetic trees \

        input sequences. The “FastTree” option computes large minimum evolution trees with profiles instead of a distance matrix. \
        [1,2]. We also offer two maximum likelihood tree building algorithms: PhyML [3] and RaxML [4]. User-defined settings \
        are required for either. PhyML and RaxML infer a more evolutionarily accurate phylogenetic topology by applying a \
        substitution model to the nucleotide sequences. This algorithm is best applied to datasets containing \
        1. fewer than 100 very long sequences, and \
        2. between 100 and 1,000 small or medium length sequences. \
        The service returns a Newick file which can be rendered in the interactive Archaeopteryx Tree Viewer in the BV-BRC or downloaded and viewed in other software.",
